	[] Professional pitch
		- Hello, my name is Jon Veach.  I just recently separated from the Navy after serving 9 and a half years and I am now enrolled at Code Fellows to become a Software Developer.  In the Navy, my primary job was IT, specializing in System and Database Administration but I dabbled in all things IT.  I learned some very valuable skills during my time and have been able to apply that to my new field.  I really love technology and it is amazing to think of where we were yesterday, where we are today, and where we'll be tomorrow.  And then think about how exactly I fit into all of this and what I can do to contribute to make the future a better place.  I also enjoy the social aspect and that you can't be the lone wolf in the basement - you really have to be social and talk to one another and grow together to make the team and the future a better place.  No matter where the future takes me, I'll be excited for the journey.
	[] What excites me about tech, 1 - 2 sentences
		- Tech really excites me because it's constantly changing and improving.  Thinking about where we were 10 years ago, where we are now, and where we'll be 10 years from now.
